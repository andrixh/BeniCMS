BeniCMS
=======

A general-purpose Content Management System for PHP 5.4+

This project has started with PHP 4 and has slowly changed to embrace the new goodness of PHP 5.
The admin section is procedural code. It is working, but in need of heavy modernization/refactoring.
The rest of the project, which is in charge of delivering the site to the visitors is newer and is organized in namespaced classes.
